Image Processing Techniques

Here are some examples of image and signal processing techniques written primarily in Matlab. More examples are to be added in Python.

## Signal Process Techniques
description for each file:

### correlation_and_lorentzian.m
in this file, creating 2d correlation map and plotting lorentzian curves are provided.
#### example of 2d correlation mapping

#### example of plotting lorentzian in different sets of parameters

### sound_signal_freq_domain.m
load audio file to matlab and transfer the signal to frequency domain using fast fourier transform function.
#### sound signal time domain plot

### apply_filters.m
here we can apply a set of different filters to smooth out noisy datasets 
#### fitting a noisy periodic data
